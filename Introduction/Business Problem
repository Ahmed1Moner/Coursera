A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.


Part 1 (Problem):
Where in Rio de Janeiro would it be best to open a restaurant. What is the place that has the most reviews, what location seems to be the most popular. Is there a type of restaurant that is more popular than another?

The problem will be solved using the Foursquare API, looking at the usercount and tipcount. This problem will help everyone that wants to open up a restaurant in Rio de Janeiro and wants to know if it is a viable option where they intend on opening.
